## Make Change Project 

### Week 1 Homework For Skill Distillery

## Overview
The project was to make a cash register application that would take in input from the user
and return the change in the highest denomination. To a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer.



## User Stories
User Story #1 The user is prompted asking for the price of the item.

User Story #2 The user is then prompted asking how much money was tendered by the customer.

User Story #3 Display an appropriate message if the customer provided too little money or the exact amount.

User Story #4 If the amount tendered is more than the cost of the item, display the number of bills and coins that should be given to the customer.

## Lessons Learned 
The major challenge was to find a way to find out how to work out the arithmetic and then transform it in to computer logic. first i had transform the change into an into pennies and round to the nearest whole number. Then i would take the remainder and change the change variable. the real challenge for me was to get the correct output by experimenting with different logic. 

Another way I could implement this project is not to use array's and maybe make it loop until the user wants to exit the program.
