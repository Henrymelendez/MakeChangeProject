## Lessons Learned 
The major challenge was to find a way to find out how to work out the arithmetic and then transform it in to computer logic. first i had transform the change into an into pennies and round to the nearest whole number. Then i would take the remainder and change the change variable. the real challenge for me was to get the correct output by experimenting with different logic. 

Another way I could implement this project is not to use array's and maybe make it loop until the user want to exit the program.
